			<h2>About this Site</h2>
			<p>
				Archery is a sport that most people still find more unique than commonplace, which leads to the lack of clubs or organizations centered around it in some areas.  Despite that, it's a sport that found a spot in my heart and one that I enjoy over all others.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through sharing pictures and videos of exciting moments I've experienced through archery, I hope other people will grow interested in the sport and try it out!  And if things turn out well, they might enjoy it just as much as I do!
