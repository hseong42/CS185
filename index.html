			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Hello, my name is Hyewon Seong and I am currently a 4th year Computer Science major at UCSB.  While programming is my major, I have a lot of love for things that are visual - which is why interfaces and how they are designed are a big interest of mine. While I am still learning about what really makes something visually appealing or successful, my passion for the topic keeps me eager to learn more.   
			</p>

				When it comes to things I enjoy in my free time, drawing and playing videogames come first (though I'm not very good at either one), and the next after that is reading murder mysteries.  Additionally, though I love most animals, dogs are my favorite, especially those that are small and fluffy, and I enjoy volunteering at animal shelters when I have time.
