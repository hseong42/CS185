			<h2>About this Site</h2>
			<p>
				Archery is a sport that most people still find more unique than commonplace, which leads to the lack of clubs or organizations centered around it in some areas.  Despite that, it's a sport that found a spot in my heart and one that I enjoy over all others.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through showing my own experience and knowledge of archery - though I am not an expert on the subject - I hope that more people will find archery interesting instead of intimidating, and try it out!
